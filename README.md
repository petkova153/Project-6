##Summary
This visualization presents the mean income and loan amounts recorded quarterly before and after the fall of the Lehman Brothers in 2008. The main variables are the size of the borrowed amount, the stated monthly income and the time of the recording. The change of the number and kinds of the employment categories are due to the fact that the company was founded 2005 and at the end of 2007 changed their policy due to negative effect of their earlier employment definitions. The borrowed amount and income for the self-employed and part-time employed people have the highest fluctuations.

##Design
The initial chosen design for the presented graph was bubble graph combined with line chart where each category can be either included or excluded. After collected remarks from at least 4 people I decided to include information about the source of information, the reasons about the changes in the definitions of the different employment groups. After the review of my initial visualization I enlarged and centered the text "Click legend to show/hide category:". I also included changed the title of the y axis and included information about what the bubble size represents. After the first review of my project I added line marking the Lehman Brothers fall in Q3 2008. I have also selected only the categories of interest: Full-time employed, Part-time employed, Self-employed and retired. I have still not succeeded in toggling categories of my graph.

Rimvydas:
"Before 2008 Q4 incomes in all categories were smaller than loans values. Biggest loan and income difference was in self-employed category and right after 2008 Q3 incomes and loans changed positions. Retired, part-time and “other” groups were almost unaffected by 2008 events. Financial crisis had biggest impact on self-employed and full-time groups. Full-time group recovered fairly fast and loans became bigger than monthly incomes, but self-employed were much more sensitive to the change. Loan and income ratio was changing all the time till 2013. Then loan grew more than monthly income and became bigger. It is clearly seen in the employed group that from 2008 overall income was stably increasing.
I think that because of what happened in 2008, people started to save money and spend less. Before that people were probably assured that their financial stability was guarantied to some degree therefore they could take bigger loans and spend more. As the time went on, people were getting back on their feet getting bigger salaries/income. This means, that most likely people “survived” 2008 financial disaster and was starting to feel confident in the near future again, thus they started to take bigger loans and bigger risks to invest in their business and overall welfare.  
The only thought that comes from this visualization is that consumers are very sensitive to changes in big financial institutions such as Lehman Brothers. And the trust in financial stability in the future has very big effect on spending and taking risk by taking loans.
	Questions: Can’t think of any."
  
Lina:
"What relationships do you notice? The crisis affects loan and income from all the types of employment.
What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization? To show the decrease of income during the crisis.  
Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic? Why do You think it is important to show such categories as Self-employed, Employed together with part time workers t.ex? Maybe that is worth to show only those who works full time and part time or to show two different visualizations"

Vytautas:
"i notice many bubbles of different sizes. probably they represent some type of data or population which is different size depending on the size of the bubble. 
Graph name indicates that X, and Y axis probably are  related to time and loan size, which i do find to be true

The first question that i have is about Y axis. No really sure what is loanOriginalAmount? Is there anything specific about it? is it real estate loan or consumer loans or both? 

I notice clear relationship between time and Loan amount. By analyzing the graph breefly I also notice one more relation which is the income amount. 

Main takeaway is the understading how people, in different empliyment categories were loaning money depending on which time period they were at, which is a very interesting analysis. Interesting to note that self emploeyd people were the least risk averse, since they were loaning highest amounts of money right before crisis.

The only thing i have question is regarding the LoanOriginalAmount. Would be good to have explanation in legends what does it refer to."

What do you notice in the visualisation?
 
Colors, bubbles and scale
 
What questions do you have about the data?
How do I make bubbles with the same color disappear?
Is there a reason for different size of bubbles?
 
What relationships do you notice?
Different colors mean different groups. Different size of bubbles means different income"

####Final version
Emiliya:
What do you think about the employment groups? - so basically they made new stuff and they messed up the old stuff but now its all good?
Did you notice that you can choose which employment group to be shown on the visualization? - Yes, I was playing until now with them.
It seems that the part time workers are the most unreliable with the highest fluctuations in borrowed amounts during 2012.Interesting if it is still the same.

Vytautas:
"What do you see? - The same as previous time but with answers to most of my earlier questions. Is there any other information you might be missing? - It was just the information about the different employment groups I was missing.
Did you notice that you can choose which employment group to be shown on the visualization? - Yes"

Jonas:
"I notice that the different employment groups have changed through the years but why the observations start 2006?
I notice that people were borrowing more before the crisis. After the crisis the self-employed people were more risk averse. Around 2012 people were borrowing more. Could it be due to lower interest rates?"

First project review:
Suggestion 1: Have you considered another vertical axis to mark 2008 Lehman crash date? Easy to do, cuts down your explanatory text and helps with pre-processing.

Suggestion 2: I think the graph is very crowded initially. Could you start with just the line graph and small bubbles and either add a button to show/hide monthly income (still bubble size) or only show monthly income when one loan category is collected?

Suggestion 3: Other and Not Available seem to be the same thing but before and after the crash. Can you merge them? Or do you need them? Do they help tell the story? What % of the data do they represent?
